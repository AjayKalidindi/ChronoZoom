It is called \"black\" because it absorbs all the light that hits the horizon, reflecting nothing, just like a perfect black body in thermodynamics. Quantum mechanics predicts that black holes emit radiation like a black body with a finite temperature. This temperature is inversely proportional to the mass of the black hole, making it difficult to observe this radiation for black holes of stellar mass or greater.

This reduction in greenhouse gases caused temperatures to plummet to an extraordinary degree, causing a global winter that only subsided after enough CO2 had been returned to the atmosphere by volcanoes.

In cultures that have not adopted metalworking technologies, the production of stone tools by knappers is common.","uri":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/54UKmikhv7Y","mediaType":"Video","UniqueID":556,"Order":9},{"id":"360f33f7-11ce-46fc-af9c-1742261048e0","parent":"9b7485ce-1a5e-4743-924c-1ee87088e031","title":"Artist's rendition of Neanderthal life","description":"Homo neanderthalensis lived in the Northern and Western areas of Eurasia during the Pleistocene epoch of the last ice Age.

Quan fa is a generic term used for open handed Chinese martial arts. Gwonbeop was developed based on the methods of the Shaolin Temple and the techniques of Jang Song Gye (장송계 hanja: 張松溪). The hanja for quan fa and gwonbeop are the same. The chapter in the muyedobotongji dealing with gwonbeop was inspired by Chinese writings describing quan fa-techniques.

Therefore, Admiral Yi ordered the fleet to feign withdrawal, which the Japanese commander observed from his tent on a rock. Then the Japanese hurriedly embarked their 12 ships and pursued the Korean fleet. The Korean navy counterattacked, with their newly completed Turtle Ship in the front, and successfully destroyed all 12 ships.

The first references to older, first generation turtle ships, known as Gwiseon (귀선), come from 1413 and 1415 though they are more famous for their role in the Japanese Invasion of Korea in the 16th century. The turtle ship was the fastest and most maneuverable existing warship in the East Asian theater, as it was powered by two sails and 80 oarsmen taking turns to handle the ship's 16 oars.

Korean admiral Yi Sun-sin is credited with designing the ship. His turtle ships were equipped with at least five different types of cannon. Their most distinguishable feature was a dragon-shaped head at the bow (front) that could launch cannon fire or flames from the mouth. Each was also equipped with a fully covered deck to deflect arrow fire, musket-shots, and incendiary weapons. The deck was covered with iron spikes to discourage enemy men from attempting to board the ship.

Scientists increasingly see their instruments through online scientific archives and analysis tools, rather than examining the raw data. Today this analysis is primarily driven by scientists asking queries, but scientific archives are becoming active databases that self-organize and recognize interesting and anomalous facts as data arrives. In some fields, data from many different archives can be cross-correlated to produce new insights. Astronomy presents an excellent example of these trends; and, federating Astronomy archives presents interesting challenges for computer scientists.","uri":"http://www.scribd.com/fullscreen/82410583?access_key=key-19mhzmz32tdlfhod9ces","mediaType":"Video","UniqueID":638,"Order":6}],"UniqueID":214}],"timelines":[],"UniqueID":670,"Regime":"Humanity","Height":150.0}],"UniqueID":203,"Regime":"Humanity","Height":80.0}],"UniqueID":226,"Regime":"Humanity","Height":20.0}],"UniqueID":260,"Regime":"Humanity","Height":10.0},{"id":"8cc539a4-2d2d-44d9-9c5c-c134655c933b","parent":"4afb5bb6-1544-4416-a949-8c8f473e544d","start":-466.0,"end":0.0,"title":"Recent History of Russia","exhibits":[],"timelines":[{"id":"be23e4bd-92df-4b70-9f13-e3976faa4209","parent":"8cc539a4-2d2d-44d9-9c5c-c134655c933b","start":-466.0,"end":-292.0,"title":"Tsardom of Russia","exhibits":[],"timelines":[],"UniqueID":680,"Regime":"Humanity","Height":null},{"id":"6b669f94-ff66-4e9c-9426-a6770e14405a","parent":"8cc539a4-2d2d-44d9-9c5c-c134655c933b","start":-292.0,"end":-96.0,"title":"Russian Empire","exhibits":[],"timelines":[],"UniqueID":681,"Regime":"Humanity","Height":null},{"id":"357388f3-4756-457f-bf2d-27e6f42ada55","parent":"8cc539a4-2d2d-44d9-9c5c-c134655c933b","start":-258.0,"end":0.0,"title":"Lomonosov Moscow State University","exhibits":[],"timelines":[{"id":"f24d5561-b0de-47c2-a306-b4d0c45863d7","parent":"357388f3-4756-457f-bf2d-27e6f42ada55","start":-43.0,"end":0.0,"title":"Faculty of Computational Mathematics and Cybernetics","exhibits":[],"timelines":[{"id":"6b64acbd-6fa4-4d2c-b552-fd73637c89bf","parent":"f24d5561-b0de-47c2-a306-b4d0c45863d7","start":-1.0,"end":0.0,"title":"ChronoZoom Moscow Team","exhibits":[],"timelines":[],"UniqueID":684,"Regime":"Humanity","Height":1.0}],"UniqueID":683,"Regime":"Humanity","Height":null}],"UniqueID":682,"Regime":"Humanity","Height":null},{"id":"36b682d9-dd6e-4d63-95ac-ce4767bc2d79","parent":"8cc539a4-2d2d-44d9-9c5c-c134655c933b","start":-96.0,"end":-22.0,"title":"Russian SFSR / Soviet Union","exhibits":[],"timelines":[],"UniqueID":678,"Regime":"Humanity","Height":null},{"id":"d76fb732-0c30-4a44-bfb0-5814fcf7eaf7","parent":"8cc539a4-2d2d-44d9-9c5c-c134655c933b","start":-21.0,"end":0.0,"title":"Russian Federation","exhibits":[],"timelines":[],"UniqueID":677,"Regime":"Humanity","Height":null}],"UniqueID":679,"Regime":"Humanity","Height":400.0},{"id":"e03776b6-f769-4cfd-a27b-2adc72e27bdc","parent":"4afb5bb6-1544-4416-a949-8c8f473e544d","start":-413.0,"end":0.0,"title":"History of Computing","exhibits":[{"id":"27be3444-4557-4b67-924d-f5f518284be6","parent":"e03776b6-f769-4cfd-a27b-2adc72e27bdc","time":-181.0,"title":"The Babbage Engine","description":"","contentItems":[{"id":"4e07716c-d864-46fd-b68d-240c2d8d3f2c","parent":"27be3444-4557-4b67-924d-f5f518284be6","title":"Charles Babbage and his Difference Engine No. 2","description":"This video discusses the history of the invention of the Difference Engine No. 2.

Adding two numbers using gearwheels is easier to implement than multiplication or division and so the method simplifies an otherwise complex mechanism.","uri":"http://czbeta.blob.core.windows.net/images/541b03f9-d59f-453b-9ae5-3d27770d68e8_886-howitworks.jpg","mediaType":"Picture","UniqueID":718,"Order":8},{"id":"c8157fee-5b68-4d06-a368-7b0433c216d1","parent":"27be3444-4557-4b67-924d-f5f518284be6","title":"Final Vindication","description":"The project took seventeen years to complete.

However, Lovelace speculated that the machine might go beyond numbers and more generally manipulate symbols in accordance with rules. She saw that numbers could represent entities other than quantity - letters of the alphabet, notes of music - and that by manipulating numbers, computing machines could extend their powers beyond the world of mathematics. In the light of developments in the 20th century, this notion is prophetic and one that Babbage appears not to have envisioned with any clarity.","uri":"http://czbeta.blob.core.windows.net/images/3aa5b35a-6cb3-443c-b28b-ea14228feed3_884-adalovelace.jpg","mediaType":"Picture","UniqueID":715,"Order":6}],"UniqueID":223}],"timelines":[{"id":"5439167d-95a4-4b88-affe-ab8f5675420a","parent":"e03776b6-f769-4cfd-a27b-2adc72e27bdc","start":-413.0,"end":-213.0,"title":"Pre-Computer: Manual","exhibits":[],"timelines":[],"UniqueID":700,"Regime":"Humanity","Height":null},{"id":"1a5d0649-f679-4a9c-96b2-1d67da1dfa6c","parent":"e03776b6-f769-4cfd-a27b-2adc72e27bdc","start":-213.0,"end":-123.0,"title":"Pre-Computer: Mechanical & Electric.","exhibits":[],"timelines":[],"UniqueID":701,"Regime":"Humanity","Height":17.0},{"id":"c5c1cbf1-4fae-49ad-9b1c-db0f21932a27","parent":"e03776b6-f769-4cfd-a27b-2adc72e27bdc","start":-123.0,"end":-68.0,"title":"Pre-computer: Electro-mechanical","exhibits":[],"timelines":[],"UniqueID":702,"Regime":"Humanity","Height":10.0},{"id":"83d8d0bf-dab2-45d7-ac35-2335d794a762","parent":"e03776b6-f769-4cfd-a27b-2adc72e27bdc","start":-76.0,"end":-62.0,"title":"Pre-computer Electronic: Vacuum tube","exhibits":[],"timelines":[],"UniqueID":703,"Regime":"Humanity","Height":3.0},{"id":"ce864cbf-e5a4-4804-b2bc-7b333f06fa9a","parent":"e03776b6-f769-4cfd-a27b-2adc72e27bdc","start":-62.0,"end":-54.0,"title":"1st Gen: Vac.

In addition the Siberian Traps, a huge area with large amounts of volcanic activity formed during this time, releasing massive amounts of CO2 into the air. This increase in greenhouse gases combined with the newly formed supercontinent disrupted ocean currents, causing them to stagnate, releasing millions of tons of methane and CO2 into the atmosphere, creating a feedback looped that raised temperatures by almost 12 degrees Fahrenheit, devastating all life on earth.","uri":"http://czbeta.blob.core.windows.net/images/8c98a4bb-810e-42e4-9bdd-1c0c8f43aa75_CZ Volcano.jpg","mediaType":"Picture","UniqueID":522,"Order":32767}],"UniqueID":199}],"timelines":[{"id":"31fc1030-5e28-4bb6-b8cb-ad0c81f444fa","parent":"4a4897e0-ce40-4fe2-be92-5e1000466f91","start":-145500000.0,"end":-65500000.0,"title":"Cretaceous","exhibits":[],"timelines":[{"id":"c2a7ff43-3069-44e5-841a-494ea79bbe03","parent":"31fc1030-5e28-4bb6-b8cb-ad0c81f444fa","start":-145500000.0,"end":-100000000.0,"title":"Early Cretaceous","exhibits":[],"timelines":[],"UniqueID":837,"Regime":"Life","Height":null},{"id":"fec67252-02cc-4e0e-8b01-aec25641532c","parent":"31fc1030-5e28-4bb6-b8cb-ad0c81f444fa","start":-100000000.0,"end":-65500000.0,"title":"Late Cretaceous","exhibits":[],"timelines":[],"UniqueID":838,"Regime":"Life","Height":null}],"UniqueID":406,"Regime":"Life","Height":null},{"id":"e66246f6-647f-46ef-ac29-ab58b93b87ab","parent":"4a4897e0-ce40-4fe2-be92-5e1000466f91","start":-199600000.0,"end":-145500000.0,"title":"Jurassic","exhibits":[],"timelines":[],"UniqueID":405,"Regime":"Life","Height":null},{"id":"5f793bf4-ec86-4683-8667-10f4190321ea","parent":"4a4897e0-ce40-4fe2-be92-5e1000466f91","start":-251000000.0,"end":-199600000.0,"title":"Triassic","exhibits":[],"timelines":[],"UniqueID":404,"Regime":"Life","Height":null}],"UniqueID":311,"Regime":"Life","Height":null},{"id":"75405bb3-bda7-45a0-8c2b-77c1f54356b4","parent":"096717fd-64db-4416-92a7-6d35c83777d5","start":-540000000.0,"end":-251000000.0,"title":"Paleozoic","exhibits":[{"id":"abfc75db-d8e2-4b67-8ac6-51522e4dfcfb","parent":"75405bb3-bda7-45a0-8c2b-77c1f54356b4","time":-375000000.0,"title":"Mass Extinction #2","description":"","contentItems":[{"id":"3866711a-2cb4-4ed6-851d-8dc7d1d59058","parent":"abfc75db-d8e2-4b67-8ac6-51522e4dfcfb","title":"Late Devonian Mass Extinction","description":"This Mass Extinction does not seem to have as clear causes as many of the other, though we know that around 50% of generas were wiped out by it.

One suggested theory is that the evolution of plants caused an increase in erosion because they became taller and acquired deeper roots. This would have in turn fertilized the oceans very suddenly, causing large algal blooms that resulted in large anoxic events, suffocating marine life. In addition, the additional plant matter would have sequestered a large amount of carbon from the atmosphere, causing a glaciation. With fewer burrowing organisms and no large plant eaters at the time, these plants created large coal deposits, and in the process, they would have cooled the earth.","uri":"http://czbeta.blob.core.windows.net/images/3866711a-2cb4-4ed6-851d-8dc7d1d59058_Red_tide.jpg","mediaType":"Picture","UniqueID":469,"Order":32767}],"UniqueID":164},{"id":"c0ef34bf-71ba-4473-902a-476f65fd429b","parent":"75405bb3-bda7-45a0-8c2b-77c1f54356b4","time":-450000000.0,"title":"Mass Extinction #1","description":"","contentItems":[{"id":"ae53c8c5-e0ee-4e8c-bdeb-ffa4858f50d0","parent":"c0ef34bf-71ba-4473-902a-476f65fd429b","title":"Ordovician-Silurian extinction event","description":"The first of 5 large mass extinction events, the Ordovician-Silurian extinction event marked a time where nearly 60% of marine invertebrates died off.
