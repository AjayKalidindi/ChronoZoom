This reduction in greenhouse gases caused temperatures to plummet to an extraordinary degree, causing a global winter that only subsided after enough CO2 had been returned to the atmosphere by volcanoes.

One suggested theory is that the evolution of plants caused an increase in erosion because they became taller and acquired deeper roots. This would have in turn fertilized the oceans very suddenly, causing large algal blooms that resulted in large anoxic events, suffocating marine life. In addition, the additional plant matter would have sequestered a large amount of carbon from the atmosphere, causing a glaciation.

It is named after the ancient Greek deity of the sky Uranus (Ancient Greek: Οὐρανός), the father of Cronus (Saturn) and grandfather of Zeus (Jupiter). Though it is visible to the naked eye like the five classical planets, it was never recognized as a planet by ancient observers because of its dimness and slow orbit. Sir William Herschel announced its discovery on March 13, 1781, expanding the known boundaries of the Solar System for the first time in modern history. Uranus was also the first planet discovered with a telescope.","Date":null,"HasBibliography":false,"ID":"5f4bf433-efeb-4ee3-84b6-b1fa792a4f7e","MediaSource":"http:\/\/commons.wikimedia.org\/wiki\/File:Uranus.jpg","MediaType":"Picture","Order":32767,"Regime":"Cosmos","Threshold":"3.
