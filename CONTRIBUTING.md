# Contributing Guidelines #

- Prior to making a pull request, be sure to apply the latest changes from master to your working branch.
- Add meaningful comments when you make your commits.
- Use the project's coding style, not your own. Follow the existing code as an example of what to do.
- Use [Stylecop](http://stylecop.codeplex.com/) to ensure that your code is conformant with project style.
