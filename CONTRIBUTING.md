# Contributing Guidelines #

- Prior to making a pull request, be sure to apply the latest changes from master to your working branch.
- Add meaningful comments when you make your commits.
- Use the project's coding style, not your own. Follow the existing code as an example of what to do.
- Use [Stylecop](http://stylecop.codeplex.com/) to ensure that your code is conformant with project style.

Add links for all of our other docs.

Need to reference the requirement to sign an OuterCurve Contributors Agreement to assign copyright of contributions over to the foundation.

Will need them to run unit tests before submitting.
